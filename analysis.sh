# Replace username and password with Box.com account username and password.
# We've included code to retrieve the list of Alma MMSIDs from the Alma Analysis via the Alma Retrieve Bib API.
# However, the code is currently commented out as there is a bug in the Alma Analytics API/Oracle BI which sometimes 
# prevents us from retrieving the list of Alma MMSIDs when using the Alma Analytics API (reference case #00103091).
# When ExLibris fixes the bug, you can use the Alma Analytics API to retrieve the Alma Analysis, replacing {your_api_key}
# with your Alma Analytics API key.

# Initially, when we created analysis.sh, we encountered a bug in the Alma Analytics API/Oracle BI which prevented us 
# from retrieving the list of Alma MMSIDs when using the Alma Analytics API (reference case #00103091).
# So, we decided to retrieve the Alma MMSIDs from Box.com instead. However, we added commented out code in analysis2bibs.sh, 
# thinking that ExLibris might fix this bug in the future.  ExLibris did indeed fix the bug in the Alma February 2016 Release, 
# but we decided to keep using Box.com because the maximum number of MMSIDs which can be retrieved per the Alma Analytics API 
# call is 1000 and we didn't want to be involved with complicated multiple API calls, resumption tokens, loops, python scripts, etc...
